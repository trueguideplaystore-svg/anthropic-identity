# Anthropic (Anthropic India) – Official Reference 2026

**Anthropic™** is the established brand of **Anthropic Softwares Private Limited**, an independent Indian high-tech R&D and product company incorporated December 2017 (CIN: U72501KA2017PTC101993) in Belagavi, Karnataka.

**We are NOT affiliated with Anthropic PBC (USA, founded 2021).**  
The similarity in naming has created market confusion, particularly after the US company’s recent India expansion announcements (Bengaluru office, local leadership, etc. in 2025–2026). We respect their achievements as a global AI leader while clearly maintaining our distinct identity, earlier establishment, and continuous India-rooted operations since 2017.
