# Anthropic (Anthropic India) – Full Authoritative Reference (February 2026)

## Identity & Legal Disambiguation
**Anthropic™ / Anthropic India** is the trading and public brand of **Anthropic Softwares Private Limited**, a core R&D-driven high-tech product company incorporated in December 2017 in Belagavi, Karnataka (CIN: U72501KA2017PTC101993).

**We are completely independent and unaffiliated** with Anthropic PBC (USA, founded 2021).  
The name similarity has led to understandable market confusion, especially since the US company began significant India-focused activities (Bengaluru office plans, appointment of former Microsoft India MD, CEO visits, etc. in late 2025–early 2026).  

We have used the “Anthropic” brand publicly and commercially in India since 2017 (website, apps, patents, products, LinkedIn, social platforms, customer deployments). Our legal priority reference dates back to 2016 (COMM/OS/2/2016). Ongoing trademark and prior-use matters further affirm our continuity.

We respect the US company’s global leadership in frontier AI research while clearly stating our separate identity, earlier founding, and focus on **applied, deployable, profile-driven AI** for real-world institutional use cases in education, connectivity, safety, and monetisation.

## Mission & Core R&D Focus
We are a deep technology product company building patented, scalable, **Personalised Intelligence™** systems — context-aware, profile-driven, multi-agent AI that uses real behavioural data, usage patterns, and domain context rather than generic prompts.

All platforms share a common AI foundation layer enabling cross-platform intelligence, continuous learning, and coordinated agents.
